		<p>The rise of the internet within mainstream culture is largely correlated with its history as a visual medium. Like many other computer systems and applications, it took a graphic interface to get the general population to start to understand the internet’s potential. The personal computer would not have proliferated throughout our households and work environments without the display monitor, and still did not become widely used until electronic spreadsheets, word processors and video games started attracting users. Similarly, users did not start buying into the World Wide Web until the visual-oriented web browser started coming into its own in the early 1990s. And since that time, even though there have been dramatic improvements in web technology and aesthetics, some of the earliest web design techniques have persevered throughout the years.</p>

		<h1>The Old Web</h1>
		<p>The idea of the internet had existed in some form for at least a half a century before it finally became a common household utility in the 1990s. Conceived in the 1980s, the World Wide Web gained significant traction with the introduction of the Mosaic browser in 1993. Shortly thereafter, businesses began recognizing the web’s commercial potential, as network infrastructure grew to accommodate what would prove to be a massive influx of online activity. Then the tech bubble grew and burst, the survivors of which (Google, Amazon and the like) went from being key tech influencers to veritable corporate giants within about a decade.</p>
		<p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee (then a fellow at the CERN Laboratory in Europe) outlined his concept of a computer platform that could facilitate collaboration among researchers who are based in different parts of the world. This led to the invention of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) in 1990. Strongly based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), HTML became the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web, and remains at the core of its coding and infrastructure. The standard enabled coders with the ability to organize web page layouts that could be understood and interacted with over interconnected networks.
